# Sinatra To Rails Pick 1 Of 3 
 
##Learning Competencies
- Identify the differences between Sinatra and Rails.
- Implement a solved problem (something that you've solved/done before) in different frameworks.
- Familiarity with Rails moving parts and the 'Rails way'.

##Summary 

 Pick one of the following three Sinatra-based challenges and build it in Rails:

1. [Craigslist, Jr.](../../../craigslist-jr-challenge)
2. [Stack Overflow Clone](../../../sinatra-overflow-challenge)
3. [Hacker News Clone](../../../hacker-news-clone-part-1-challenge)

Focus first and foremost on doing things the "Rails way."  Rails' idiomatic style can be frustrating coming from simpler, more explicit frameworks like Sinatra, but the sooner you [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) how Rails sees the world the more productive you'll be.

## Objectives

If you need a specific area to focus on, [Rails form helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html) are a great place to start.  Form helpers are the collection of view helpers that Rails uses to generate, manipulate, and submit forms.
 

##Releases
Use the same release structure from the Sinatra project you choose.
##Optimize Your Learning 
Make sure you understand every line of code you're writing. Don't copy and paste.
